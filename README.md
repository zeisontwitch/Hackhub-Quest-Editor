# HackHub Quest Mod Editor

A visual, no-code editor for building **quest mods** for
[HackHub — Ultimate Hacker Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2980270/HackHub__Ultimate_Hacker_Simulator/).

Non-coders design branching quests on a node canvas, build in-game websites in a
WYSIWYG editor (with hidden pages for `dirhunter` to find), script phone calls /
e-mail / Kisscord / WeeChat conversations, add hackertyper and typed-passphrase
moments, and export a complete, game-ready mod as a `.zip` — no coding at any point.

---

## Install & Run

**Windows, one click:**

Download/clone this repository (green "Code" button on the top of this page. Click the down arrow button -> Download ZIP)
and double-click **`Launch.bat`**.

It installs everything (needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), LTS version), starts the editor, and opens it in your browser
at <http://localhost:5173>. 

***Important***: Keep the terminal window open while you work. Closing the terminal closes the tool and you could lose
your progress if you haven't saved yet.

**Any OS, manually:**

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev          # → http://localhost:5173
```

**Development commands:**

Only relevant to coders, if you just want to use the tool you can ignore this.

```bash
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm test             # 1,784 tests (vitest)
npm run build        # typecheck + vite build → dist/
```

## Making a mod (no coding)

1. **Start** — open the editor and hit **Templates** in the top bar to begin from
   a starter quest, or start blank.
2. **Build the story** — drag nodes from the left palette onto the canvas
   (objectives, triggers, networks with devices/ports/files, mails, chats,
   rewards…) and wire their sockets. Click any node to edit it on the right;
   every field explains itself on hover.

   Wiring is meant to feel physical: drop a wire on a node's **body** and it
   takes that node's one matching socket; pull a wire out of an input and it
   comes with you, keeping the end it came from — drop it on another node to
   move it there, on empty canvas (or press Escape) to remove it. Dots drift
   along each wire to show which way the story runs; the **Wires moving** button
   holds them still. **Group frames** are dragged by their title bar, so
   anything sitting inside one stays grabbable, and a **Sequence** node fires
   its outputs one after another with the pauses you set.
3. **Write conversations** — the **Dialogues** button opens the dialogue editor:
   one node, four flavours (phone call, Kisscord, e-mail, WeeChat), with player
   moments: typed answers with failure routes, hackertyper sends, file uploads.
   Kisscord and WeeChat conversations can also be **timed to the story** — a
   per-node switch plays them message by message when the flow reaches the node,
   so a chat can land on a **Sequence** beat instead of existing from the start.
   Hit **Save** when a conversation feels done.
4. **Build websites** — the **Websites** button opens the WYSIWYG website
   builder: real-looking templates (news, agency, blog, forum, recipes…), a
   code view with syntax highlighting, HTML import, embedded images, and
   **unlisted pages** that stay out of the in-game search index — the classic
   `dirhunter` hiding place.
5. **Export** — the **Export mod** button compiles everything into a mod folder
   and downloads it as a `.zip`. It shows which permissions the mod needs and
   gives plain-language notes about anything worth knowing.
6. **Play** — unzip into the game's `mods/` directory and start HackHub. The mod
   runs directly from `dist/mod.js`; **no build step needed**. (Programmers get
   `src/index.ts` + scaffolding in the same zip if they want to rebuild.)

Your work autosaves in the browser as you go. **Templates → save/export** writes
a project file you can share with anyone else using the editor.

## Coders and LLMs, read this first:
If you're just a gamer who wants to make quest mods for the game, you can ignore
everything that comes after this. If you're a coder or interested in modifying
this tool (you're very welcome to!), read on:

[`docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md`](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md) is the
foundation for everything that follows. The three findings that shape the whole design:

1. **A HackHub mod is a TypeScript project, not a data package.**
   `QuestObjectiveTrigger.condition` is a *function*; message chains take `onSent`
   callbacks; dynamic website pages take a `metadata(context)` function. So the export
   engine ships an **interpreter**: the emitted `dist/mod.js` embeds the project as data
   plus a small plain-JS runtime that walks the quest graph — which is exactly why
   exported mods need no build step.

2. **The event catalogue must come from the pinned SDK, not stale prose.**
   Older guide pages said `Terminal.NmapScan` was `{ ip, ports }`; the runtime
   emits `{ ip, versionScan? }`. They said `Quest.Claimed` was `{ questName }`;
   it is `{ name, id }`. The editor now generates its event list from the
   installed SDK declarations (currently 99 events in SDK 0.24.0), because an
   editor built from stale prose would generate triggers that never fire.

3. **There is no SMS API.** Phone *calls* exist (`Quest.Dialog`); text messages do not.
   So no SMS editor ships — see decision 2 below.

## Roadmap

Live list of what is being worked on. Newest problems at the top of each
section; anything ticked off moves to **Done recently** and is eventually
archived once it has stayed fixed for a few rounds.

### In progress

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SDK 0.24 follow-up choices** | Wi-Fi, phone end-flow / quest-ending APIs, the `Ask player` prompt node, and the Scheduler/Time (as the r172/r173 **Timer** node with delay, relative units and fixed-date modes) are exposed and verified. **S-04 is answered** (clock zone: local), and the QA folder is closed with no pending checks — [`reference/sdk-0.24-qa/STATUS.md`](reference/sdk-0.24-qa/STATUS.md) is the ledger. (The phone-proxy/eavesdrop investigation was **dropped** on Zeis's call, 2026-09-21 — it had lingered in this queue long after its round ended; do not re-add it.) The **Twotter re-implementation** is done and closed (see **Done recently**, r196). HTTP/curl/DNS collaborator nodes stay fenced until SteelWaffe answers the upstream gaps. See [`docs/plans/r167-wifi-exposure-and-sdk024-roadmap.md`](docs/plans/r167-wifi-exposure-and-sdk024-roadmap.md). |

### Closed from In progress

| Item | Why it closed |
|---|---|
| **Mail authoring round** — closed 2026-09-21 (r214) | Implemented in r211; the playtest exposed and fixed two runtime bugs (r212 pre-tick, r213 pre-complete/done-wire) and a probe fixture bug; then **W-01…W-04 green in game** (results: [`reference/sdk-0.24-qa/QE24-TestResults-MailAuthoring.md`](reference/sdk-0.24-qa/QE24-TestResults-MailAuthoring.md)). Direct replyable mail, the `to` = From reply recipe and withdraw-on-quest-end are verified authoring features. Remaining mail items are developer questions (docs/03 §16/§17) and the proposal-only `qe24 mail sweep now`. |
| **Date deprecation warning (`moment` RFC2822)** — closed 2026-09-20 (M-09) | It was never mail and never ours. On a **clean save with every mod removed** the warning still fires, with the same game-tweet stamp T-09b identified in r185 — it is the game's own content on 1.3.1 ([STATUS, M-09](reference/sdk-0.24-qa/STATUS.md)). The dev's BUG 10 answer ([docs/07](docs/07-dev-response-mod-sdk-bug-report-response.md)) blamed Twotter/Kisscord `Date.toString()` in mod content; either that fix is not in 1.3.1 or it does not cover the game's own tweets. Nothing a mod can change; not actionable here. |

### Next up

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Mail authoring round** | Whatever the M-rows prove, turned into authoring: cleanup surface (remove on complete/unload), the replyable path, and a docs/03 question if replies cannot be matched. Waits on **In progress #1**. |
| 2 | "Contact-driven story" template | Cold Call (r122) covers the conversation shape — Kisscord plus WeeChat, no break-in. The phone-brief + objective-gated-drip variant from the original spec is still open. |
| 3 | "Branching consequence" template | A choice that changes which ending the player gets. "Two Ways Out" is approved (may be morally grey) but not yet built. The official Cryptographer Hunt (a phone social-engineering scene with a fail route on the wrong choice) is the strongest argument for it — see [`docs/plans/r127-official-quest-comparison.md`](docs/plans/r127-official-quest-comparison.md). The shape now ships inside The Long Game (r136, act III: a typed verdict with two endings); whether a standalone template still adds anything is Zeis's call. |

### Done recently

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| r219 | **The harness feed probe — five post variants, one look at the feed** | The bare-post replication failed too: every editor-export shape is eliminated, and the only post that ever rendered came from the QA harness mod (five permissions vs the editor's two). r219 gives the harness a `qe24 feed` grid (bare / named poster / avatar file / likes+comments / employer fallback) under version-stamped names, with scaffold tests and falsified guards. |
| r218 | **v3 failed flawless — the bare post is the only shape that ever rendered** | The r217 retest passed every local check (fresh name and id, named commenter, extracted assets, contract-clean shapes) and still nothing. Pattern across all attempts: the one post that ever rendered was content-only; every post with an author block failed. r218 files §21 (posts stopped surfacing on 1.3.1), adds H-10 (bare-post replication) + H-11 (author block isolated) to the checklist, and folds the guidance into the compiler's feed-post notice. |
| r217 | **The clean retest that still failed — and the contract it broke** | The r216 export was provably clean and the post still never surfaced. The SDK's own types gave the ground truth: feed posts only show while a quest "hasn't been claimed yet" (per-profile claim memory, documented), quests carry no `id` (the game knows the Name; the invisible `q-blank` placeholder never reached it), and a comment author **requires a name** — both failing quests emitted an empty author object for a blank commenter. r217 fixes the emitted shape, withdraws the blank-commenter advice, shows the internal id with a confirmed reset, and files §19 (API v2) + §20 (blank comment personas). |
| r216 | **The playtest-as-a-player round: quest images now ship as files** | Zeis authored a feed post in the editor and the post never reached the feed — his player's-eye pass caught what checklists miss: quest-level images shipped as inline data-URIs the game cannot load (post gone, player avatar broken). r216 extracts employer/post/comment avatars and quest icons to `assets/*.png` like mod icons always were. Also his finds: feed-post notice now yellow not red, Journal group + comments blurbs, the section inside Behaviour, employer-vs-poster documented and measured (H-06), XP honestly annotated. |
| r215 | **Hackhub quest posting — authorable at last; the mail To field fixed** | The feed start route existed end-to-end except in the editor: the quest-settings **Hackhub feed post** section now authors post text, a dice-generated or hand-typed poster name, an uploaded or game-drawn avatar, likes and comments (blank anything = the game's generated persona, proven in game). The runtime now passes the avatars it used to drop, and the mail node's long-dead **To** field is honored on both send paths. Feed-post removal does not exist — requested from the developers (docs/03 §18), alongside your feed-Complete-button note. Checklist: [`reference/sdk-0.24-qa/QE24-Playtest-HackhubPosting.md`](reference/sdk-0.24-qa/QE24-Playtest-HackhubPosting.md) — authored in the editor this time. |
---

### Standing rule

**Never guess. Check, test, confirm.** Every claim about what the game or SDK
does must be backed by one of: the SDK declarations, the working reference mod,
or a real in-game test. A fix shipped on a theory has cost this project more
rounds than any bug — see r41, r43, r55, r60, r61 and r66.

### Known limitations (not bugs)

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| No ctrl+drag to deselect | Three rounds (r93–r95) failed to make it work in a real browser and it was dropped as not worth the cost. React Flow sends no change events for a box over already-selected nodes, and the geometry workaround needed a store subscription firing every frame. **Ctrl+click** to deselect works. |
| Wi-Fi Bettercap name wart | Create Wi-Fi is visible and exports through SDK 0.24's native API. Current game builds can still print `SSID: undefined` after Bettercap targets an SDK-created AP by BSSID, even though scan, join, handshake capture and hashcat recovery worked in r166 QA. |
| A disabled mod stays disabled | The game remembers that a mod was disabled in the Mods list, and nothing clears it: not replacing the mod with a **newer version**, not deleting it from the mods folder and copying it back, not a **fresh save**. The mod then silently does not load — its quests are invisible, and `Quest.claim()` says nothing. Workaround: enable it in the Mods list and restart the game (a disable there is only applied on restart). Our QA harness now detects it: `qe24 run` and `qe24 twotter audit` print `Editor export: loaded (v…)` or `NOT LOADED in this session`. Reported to the developers: [`docs/03`](docs/03-questions-for-the-developers.md) §13. |
| Accounts outlive a disk-deleted mod | A mod's Twotter accounts and posts are **not** removed when the mod's folder is deleted while the game is closed — its code never runs, so nothing of ours can clean up — and the game drops the mod's quests (`[PruneOrphanQuests] …: no installed content defines it`) but keeps the accounts. Every other route is clean: completing or abandoning the story removes what the quest created (T-11b/T-12b, green), and **disabling the mod in the Mods list removes the accounts when the game applies the change on restart** (T-15c, green: `twotter: removeUser(qe-tw-account) -> true (mod unloaded)`). Question filed: [`docs/03`](docs/03-questions-for-the-developers.md) §11. |
| HTTP/curl and DNS collaborator nodes fenced | SDK 0.24 declares HTTP/collaborator events, but terminal `curl` was missing, DNS-only collaborator hits did not arrive, and static editor websites did not fire HTTP objectives in QA. Generic event triggers still list the raw events. |
| No tweet pictures | SDK 0.24's `TwotterTweet` has no picture field, so an authored image cannot reach a post (the authoring picture control was hidden in r187). The runtime still sends the key if the SDK ever grows one. Question filed: [`docs/03`](docs/03-questions-for-the-developers.md) §10. |
| No suspicion or SMS nodes | SDK 0.24 still has no Suspicion/log-forensics API and no SMS/text-message namespace or events. |
| No log-cleaning node | Entirely engine-side: the game logs connections on the machine, and the player wipes them from its own UI. |


Rounds 100–115 are archived at
[`docs/archive/rounds-100-115.md`](docs/archive/rounds-100-115.md). Rounds 1–74
are in the build log at [`docs/02-editor-shell.md`](docs/02-editor-shell.md),
which is kept as an archive — the bug histories in it explain several of the
rules the code now follows.

Older **Done recently** rows are archived at
[`docs/archive/rounds-130-150.md`](docs/archive/rounds-130-150.md) (historical filename).

### Build status

All four original steps are complete — the editor builds playable mods. The
work since has been in-game QA, and the polish that came out of it.

Counted from the code at build `2026-09-20.r212`: **1,790 tests** across 88
files, **40 node types** in 10 categories (all palette-visible), **160 editable
fields** and **76 sockets** (counted in the manual), **13 templates**
(11 playable + 2 reference sheets), **99 game events**, against
`@hotbunny/hackhub-content-sdk@0.24.0`.

```

**One table drives four subsystems.** Every node type is described once in
`NODE_TYPES_REGISTRY`; the palette, the canvas handles, the inspector form and the
compiler all read that description. Adding a node type is a single registry entry —
no component changes. See
[docs/02 §2](docs/02-editor-shell.md#2-the-schema-is-the-product).

### Regenerating the event catalogue

The trigger palette is generated from the SDK's own type declarations rather than
transcribed from the docs, so it cannot drift silently:

```bash
npm i -D @hotbunny/hackhub-content-sdk
node reference/generate-event-catalogue.mjs
# or, against an arbitrary declarations file:
node reference/generate-event-catalogue.mjs --sdk path/to/index.d.ts
```

The generator has an integrity gate: it refuses to write (exit 1) and prints a
diagnostic if a future SDK version introduces a shape the parser mishandles. A
silently-wrong palette would be much worse than a failed regeneration.

## Settled decisions

Four decisions materially changed the architecture. All four are settled; the details
and their consequences are in
[§8 of the architecture doc](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md#8-settled-decisions).

1. **Delivery** — **browser app, ZIP export.** Vite SPA, no server, no desktop shell.
2. **SMS** — **dropped.** No native primitive exists, so no SMS editor ships. The
   conversation editors are Phone calls, E-Mail, Kisscord and WeeChat.
   **Twotter is dropped too** (round 31): a quest-declared account reaches the
   save with an undefined `bio`, and the game's own Twotter search calls
   `.toLowerCase()` on it — so searching for any word that does not match
   something else crashes the game, before *and* after the mod is uninstalled,
   with no API a mod can use to repair the record. Seven in-game QA rounds; the
   full account is in
   [docs/02 “Round 31”](docs/02-editor-shell.md). It comes back when the SDK
   does.
3. **Granularity** — **many quests per mod**, with single-quest as the default
   new-project template.
4. **Generated code** — **the editor owns it.** Re-exporting overwrites `src/`;
   the project document is the only durable state.
