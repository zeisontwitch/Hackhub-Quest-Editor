# HackHub Quest Mod Editor

A visual, no-code editor for building **quest mods** for
[HackHub — Ultimate Hacker Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2980270/HackHub__Ultimate_Hacker_Simulator/).

Non-coders design branching quests on a node canvas, build in-game websites in a
WYSIWYG editor (with hidden pages for `dirhunter` to find), script phone calls /
e-mail / Kisscord / WeeChat conversations, add hackertyper and typed-passphrase
moments, and export a complete, game-ready mod as a `.zip` — no coding at any point.

---

## Install & Run

**Windows, one click:**

Download/clone this repository (green "Code" button on the top of this page. Click the down arrow button -> Download ZIP)
and double-click **`Launch.bat`**.

It installs everything (needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), LTS version), starts the editor, and opens it in your browser
at <http://localhost:5173>. 

***Important***: Keep the terminal window open while you work. Closing the terminal closes the tool and you could lose
your progress if you haven't saved yet.

**Any OS, manually:**

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev          # → http://localhost:5173
```

**Development commands:**

Only relevant to coders, if you just want to use the tool you can ignore this.

```bash
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm test             # 1,776 tests (vitest)
npm run build        # typecheck + vite build → dist/
```

## Making a mod (no coding)

1. **Start** — open the editor and hit **Templates** in the top bar to begin from
   a starter quest, or start blank.
2. **Build the story** — drag nodes from the left palette onto the canvas
   (objectives, triggers, networks with devices/ports/files, mails, chats,
   rewards…) and wire their sockets. Click any node to edit it on the right;
   every field explains itself on hover.

   Wiring is meant to feel physical: drop a wire on a node's **body** and it
   takes that node's one matching socket; pull a wire out of an input and it
   comes with you, keeping the end it came from — drop it on another node to
   move it there, on empty canvas (or press Escape) to remove it. Dots drift
   along each wire to show which way the story runs; the **Wires moving** button
   holds them still. **Group frames** are dragged by their title bar, so
   anything sitting inside one stays grabbable, and a **Sequence** node fires
   its outputs one after another with the pauses you set.
3. **Write conversations** — the **Dialogues** button opens the dialogue editor:
   one node, four flavours (phone call, Kisscord, e-mail, WeeChat), with player
   moments: typed answers with failure routes, hackertyper sends, file uploads.
   Kisscord and WeeChat conversations can also be **timed to the story** — a
   per-node switch plays them message by message when the flow reaches the node,
   so a chat can land on a **Sequence** beat instead of existing from the start.
   Hit **Save** when a conversation feels done.
4. **Build websites** — the **Websites** button opens the WYSIWYG website
   builder: real-looking templates (news, agency, blog, forum, recipes…), a
   code view with syntax highlighting, HTML import, embedded images, and
   **unlisted pages** that stay out of the in-game search index — the classic
   `dirhunter` hiding place.
5. **Export** — the **Export mod** button compiles everything into a mod folder
   and downloads it as a `.zip`. It shows which permissions the mod needs and
   gives plain-language notes about anything worth knowing.
6. **Play** — unzip into the game's `mods/` directory and start HackHub. The mod
   runs directly from `dist/mod.js`; **no build step needed**. (Programmers get
   `src/index.ts` + scaffolding in the same zip if they want to rebuild.)

Your work autosaves in the browser as you go. **Templates → save/export** writes
a project file you can share with anyone else using the editor.

## Coders and LLMs, read this first:
If you're just a gamer who wants to make quest mods for the game, you can ignore
everything that comes after this. If you're a coder or interested in modifying
this tool (you're very welcome to!), read on:

[`docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md`](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md) is the
foundation for everything that follows. The three findings that shape the whole design:

1. **A HackHub mod is a TypeScript project, not a data package.**
   `QuestObjectiveTrigger.condition` is a *function*; message chains take `onSent`
   callbacks; dynamic website pages take a `metadata(context)` function. So the export
   engine ships an **interpreter**: the emitted `dist/mod.js` embeds the project as data
   plus a small plain-JS runtime that walks the quest graph — which is exactly why
   exported mods need no build step.

2. **The event catalogue must come from the pinned SDK, not stale prose.**
   Older guide pages said `Terminal.NmapScan` was `{ ip, ports }`; the runtime
   emits `{ ip, versionScan? }`. They said `Quest.Claimed` was `{ questName }`;
   it is `{ name, id }`. The editor now generates its event list from the
   installed SDK declarations (currently 99 events in SDK 0.24.0), because an
   editor built from stale prose would generate triggers that never fire.

3. **There is no SMS API.** Phone *calls* exist (`Quest.Dialog`); text messages do not.
   So no SMS editor ships — see decision 2 below.

## Roadmap

Live list of what is being worked on. Newest problems at the top of each
section; anything ticked off moves to **Done recently** and is eventually
archived once it has stayed fixed for a few rounds.

### In progress

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SDK 0.24 follow-up choices** | Wi-Fi, phone end-flow / quest-ending APIs, the `Ask player` prompt node, and the Scheduler/Time (as the r172/r173 **Timer** node with delay, relative units and fixed-date modes) are exposed and verified. **S-04 is answered** (clock zone: local), and the QA folder is closed with no pending checks — [`reference/sdk-0.24-qa/STATUS.md`](reference/sdk-0.24-qa/STATUS.md) is the ledger. Remaining queue: **mail cleanup/replyability QA**, then the phone-proxy/eavesdrop investigation. The **Twotter re-implementation** is done and closed (see **Done recently**, r196). HTTP/curl/DNS collaborator nodes stay fenced until SteelWaffe answers the upstream gaps. See [`docs/plans/r167-wifi-exposure-and-sdk024-roadmap.md`](docs/plans/r167-wifi-exposure-and-sdk024-roadmap.md). |
| 2 | **Date deprecation warning (`moment` RFC2822)** | Only appears with a quest-editor mod installed, 30–90s after a mail is sent, when a browser or app screen is opened. The stack is the game's own date formatting and we never set a date on anything — question 10 in the bug report. |

### Next up

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cheap wins: pack extras and localization — two rows open (L, M)** | ([plan](docs/plans/r199-cheap-wins-plan.md)) **Stage A closed**, **Stage B built and working in game**. Green so far: the widget, both right-click entries, German labels and quest title, the message action (a German sentence from the engine's callback, not the raw token a click logs) and the mail action (a letter arrived). The click refusal was a missing mod identity, and **r206 hands every click action to the engine, which fixes it** — the log proves the round trip. **r207 fixes the claim action**, which sent the editor's own id where `Quest.claim` wants the game's name for the quest (the game is silent about an id it does not know, so the click looked dead). **Q15**: `Handbook.open` opens the handbook at its own landing page rather than the page asked for — the article ids are not published, so the editor no longer claims the page is reached. Install export **1.0.32**; harness unchanged at **1.0.23**. |
| 2 | **Mail cleanup / replyable mail QA** | Focused QA first: `Mail.send()` id shape, `Mail.remove(id)` timing, whether `QuestMailDefinition.replyable` actually renders a Reply button, what event a reply raises, and cleanup on complete/unload. Then turn the verified parts into authoring. |
| 3 | "Contact-driven story" template | Cold Call (r122) covers the conversation shape — Kisscord plus WeeChat, no break-in. The phone-brief + objective-gated-drip variant from the original spec is still open. |
| 4 | "Branching consequence" template | A choice that changes which ending the player gets. "Two Ways Out" is approved (may be morally grey) but not yet built. The official Cryptographer Hunt (a phone social-engineering scene with a fail route on the wrong choice) is the strongest argument for it — see [`docs/plans/r127-official-quest-comparison.md`](docs/plans/r127-official-quest-comparison.md). The shape now ships inside The Long Game (r136, act III: a typed verdict with two endings); whether a standalone template still adds anything is Zeis's call. |

### Done recently

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| r207 | **`Quest.claim` wants the game's name for a quest, not our id — and says nothing if it does not know it** | Row I of the r206 run: the claim entry did nothing at all. The action was sending the quest's **document id**, while the harness command and the runtime's own unclaim node have always used the **engine's name** for the quest — and the game gives no error for an id it does not recognise, so a wrong claim and a dead click look identical. The compiler now resolves the author's pick to the quest's name at export, the runtime logs the name it claims, and an action whose quest is gone says so instead of doing nothing. Falsified: sending the id back again turns the fence red. |
| r206 | **A click cannot do anything that needs permission — so it no longer tries** | ([plan](docs/plans/r199-cheap-wins-plan.md)) Row H of the r205 run ran one click that tried every channel and then the same UI calls from a 1 ms `Scheduler` job. Verbatim: `UI.notify`, `UI.toast`, `Mail.send` and `Quest.claim` all `refused: [ContentSDK] Mod "null" …`, while `Scheduler.schedule`, `DEFERRED UI.toast` and `DEFERRED UI.notify` all `WORKED`. So the engine hands the mod's identity back to its own callback, and the runtime now routes every click action through it: the click logs what it was, hands the action over (kind `qe/<mod id>/click`, job id in the payload, action in a table), and the action runs in the callback — with a fallback to the old in-click run for a build without `Scheduler`. Row G green: German labels in the start menu and both right-click menus. Three new start-menu entries in the QA export so all four action kinds can be clicked for real. **Lesson worth keeping:** the older `Mod "null"` refusal also swallowed the *translation* table — the click logged the raw key and the callback logged the sentence. |
| r205 | **A click has no mod identity — the game refuses every gated call from one** | ([plan](docs/plans/r199-cheap-wins-plan.md)) The second in-game run of the pack-extras rows pasted a log that settled three questions at once. **The click lands** (`extras: menu item "…" clicked`) and is then refused: `Mod "null" tried to use UI.toast without "ui" permission`. Not a missing permission — the manifest lists `ui`, the harness shows both popups from a command, and in the same session the same export's quest-context `UI.notify` drew fine. So a menu or right-click handler runs without the mod's identity and **every** gated call fails there; filed as **Q14**. Also: **`UI.notify` works** (row A: *System Notification*, *Info*), which kills the earlier worry that the editor's default Notify variant was silent. Row F green: German notification and German quest title. Row E was impossible as written — languages only switch from the main menu, which unloads the mod — so it became row G. New harness command `qe24 clickprobe on|report|off` tries every channel from one click, including a deferred `Scheduler` job that is the candidate fix. |
| r204 | **A click that looked dead, and a language that did not follow** | ([plan](docs/plans/r199-cheap-wins-plan.md)) The first pack-extras run in game: the widget and both right-click entries green, the start-menu click apparently doing nothing, and nothing translated after switching to German. The run could not tell a the game never calling us from our own notification API drawing nothing, so **every extras click now logs a line before it does anything** and names the API that showed the message. That reframed the question: **`UI.notify` — the call the editor's Notify node uses by default — has never been observed working in 1.3.1**, while every notification QA has ever seen came from `UI.toast`; extras messages now go out through toast with notify as fallback, and harness **1.0.22** adds `qe24 extras say notify|toast` (one call per command, one look each). The language half has an API answer: the SDK says text read once does not update by itself and offers `Localization.onLanguageChange`, which the runtime now uses to re-register the menu and right-click labels live — a widget's file cannot follow and is left alone. 5 new mutations falsified. |
| r203 | **Stage B: the editor's own pack extras, and the words in them** | ([plan](docs/plans/r199-cheap-wins-plan.md)) Four surfaces in one dialog — start-menu entries, desktop widgets, right-click entries, and a translation table — plus everything behind them (schema, emitter, runtime). Two probe readings are baked in: **no `section` control** (the game ignored it) and widgets **defaulted to opaque and always sent explicitly** (the SDK default is see-through, which is what made the first probe look broken). The fragile case the plan flagged turned out to be real and wider than expected: a quest's **Title** *and* a menu or right-click **label** are read at registration, so `{{tr.…}}` in those is resolved before the game sees them, while an action's message waits for the click — and `{{data.…}}` is left alone in both. 30 new tests, **14 mutations falsified** (the first `section` guard survived until the assertion ran with a form on screen). The gates caught two real bugs on the way: a bare `tokenScope()` call from a sibling scope broke every token in every quest, and a defaulted zod object shipped `extras: {}` instead of the three arrays, which the save round-trip test noticed. |
---

### Standing rule

**Never guess. Check, test, confirm.** Every claim about what the game or SDK
does must be backed by one of: the SDK declarations, the working reference mod,
or a real in-game test. A fix shipped on a theory has cost this project more
rounds than any bug — see r41, r43, r55, r60, r61 and r66.

### Known limitations (not bugs)

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| No ctrl+drag to deselect | Three rounds (r93–r95) failed to make it work in a real browser and it was dropped as not worth the cost. React Flow sends no change events for a box over already-selected nodes, and the geometry workaround needed a store subscription firing every frame. **Ctrl+click** to deselect works. |
| Wi-Fi Bettercap name wart | Create Wi-Fi is visible and exports through SDK 0.24's native API. Current game builds can still print `SSID: undefined` after Bettercap targets an SDK-created AP by BSSID, even though scan, join, handshake capture and hashcat recovery worked in r166 QA. |
| A disabled mod stays disabled | The game remembers that a mod was disabled in the Mods list, and nothing clears it: not replacing the mod with a **newer version**, not deleting it from the mods folder and copying it back, not a **fresh save**. The mod then silently does not load — its quests are invisible, and `Quest.claim()` says nothing. Workaround: enable it in the Mods list and restart the game (a disable there is only applied on restart). Our QA harness now detects it: `qe24 run` and `qe24 twotter audit` print `Editor export: loaded (v…)` or `NOT LOADED in this session`. Reported to the developers: [`docs/03`](docs/03-questions-for-the-developers.md) §13. |
| Accounts outlive a disk-deleted mod | A mod's Twotter accounts and posts are **not** removed when the mod's folder is deleted while the game is closed — its code never runs, so nothing of ours can clean up — and the game drops the mod's quests (`[PruneOrphanQuests] …: no installed content defines it`) but keeps the accounts. Every other route is clean: completing or abandoning the story removes what the quest created (T-11b/T-12b, green), and **disabling the mod in the Mods list removes the accounts when the game applies the change on restart** (T-15c, green: `twotter: removeUser(qe-tw-account) -> true (mod unloaded)`). Question filed: [`docs/03`](docs/03-questions-for-the-developers.md) §11. |
| HTTP/curl and DNS collaborator nodes fenced | SDK 0.24 declares HTTP/collaborator events, but terminal `curl` was missing, DNS-only collaborator hits did not arrive, and static editor websites did not fire HTTP objectives in QA. Generic event triggers still list the raw events. |
| No tweet pictures | SDK 0.24's `TwotterTweet` has no picture field, so an authored image cannot reach a post (the authoring picture control was hidden in r187). The runtime still sends the key if the SDK ever grows one. Question filed: [`docs/03`](docs/03-questions-for-the-developers.md) §10. |
| No suspicion or SMS nodes | SDK 0.24 still has no Suspicion/log-forensics API and no SMS/text-message namespace or events. |
| No log-cleaning node | Entirely engine-side: the game logs connections on the machine, and the player wipes them from its own UI. |


Rounds 100–115 are archived at
[`docs/archive/rounds-100-115.md`](docs/archive/rounds-100-115.md). Rounds 1–74
are in the build log at [`docs/02-editor-shell.md`](docs/02-editor-shell.md),
which is kept as an archive — the bug histories in it explain several of the
rules the code now follows.

### Build status

All four original steps are complete — the editor builds playable mods. The
work since has been in-game QA, and the polish that came out of it.

Counted from the code at build `2026-09-19.r207`: **1,776 tests** across 88
files, **40 node types** in 10 categories (all palette-visible), **160 editable
fields** and **76 sockets** (counted in the manual), **13 templates**
(11 playable + 2 reference sheets), **99 game events**, against
`@hotbunny/hackhub-content-sdk@0.24.0`.

```

**One table drives four subsystems.** Every node type is described once in
`NODE_TYPES_REGISTRY`; the palette, the canvas handles, the inspector form and the
compiler all read that description. Adding a node type is a single registry entry —
no component changes. See
[docs/02 §2](docs/02-editor-shell.md#2-the-schema-is-the-product).

### Regenerating the event catalogue

The trigger palette is generated from the SDK's own type declarations rather than
transcribed from the docs, so it cannot drift silently:

```bash
npm i -D @hotbunny/hackhub-content-sdk
node reference/generate-event-catalogue.mjs
# or, against an arbitrary declarations file:
node reference/generate-event-catalogue.mjs --sdk path/to/index.d.ts
```

The generator has an integrity gate: it refuses to write (exit 1) and prints a
diagnostic if a future SDK version introduces a shape the parser mishandles. A
silently-wrong palette would be much worse than a failed regeneration.

## Settled decisions

Four decisions materially changed the architecture. All four are settled; the details
and their consequences are in
[§8 of the architecture doc](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md#8-settled-decisions).

1. **Delivery** — **browser app, ZIP export.** Vite SPA, no server, no desktop shell.
2. **SMS** — **dropped.** No native primitive exists, so no SMS editor ships. The
   conversation editors are Phone calls, E-Mail, Kisscord and WeeChat.
   **Twotter is dropped too** (round 31): a quest-declared account reaches the
   save with an undefined `bio`, and the game's own Twotter search calls
   `.toLowerCase()` on it — so searching for any word that does not match
   something else crashes the game, before *and* after the mod is uninstalled,
   with no API a mod can use to repair the record. Seven in-game QA rounds; the
   full account is in
   [docs/02 “Round 31”](docs/02-editor-shell.md). It comes back when the SDK
   does.
3. **Granularity** — **many quests per mod**, with single-quest as the default
   new-project template.
4. **Generated code** — **the editor owns it.** Re-exporting overwrites `src/`;
   the project document is the only durable state.
