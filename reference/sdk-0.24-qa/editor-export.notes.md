Hand-maintained. `npm run gen:qa-export` appends this file to the compiled
README.md, and the guard test (`src/compiler/__tests__/sdk024QaExport.test.ts`)
fails when that concatenation drifts. Everything else in this folder is
generated output: edit the project, then re-run the generator.

## What is in this build

Two quests auto-start on load:

- **`QESdk024EditorQa`** — the r166 surface: native Wi-Fi (`QE24-LAB-5G`) and the
  HTTP/browser events for `http://qe24-website.test/` (`/`, `/echo`, `/hidden/result`).
  The steps and the known results are below.
- **`QESdk024TimerQa`** — the r172/r173 **Timer** node (delay mode), rows S-01…S-03.
  The calendar modes (`In N days at a set time`, `On a specific in-game date & time`)
  are not baked into this export — a fixed date in a committed file would be in the
  past by the time it is played. Make that edit in the editor before exporting, or
  run the S-04 clock comparison from `../README.md`.

### `QESdk024TimerQa` — S-01…S-03

| Row | What to do | Green means |
|---|---|---|
| S-01 | Load the save and watch. Timer A is 2 in-game minutes — about 2 real seconds at the default 60× clock. | The mail **Timer A arrived (S-01 green)** and the **Timer A fired** toast appear. |
| S-02 | Save and reload before Timer B (2 in-game hours) is due. | **Timer B fired** appears after the reload: the job survived the save. |
| S-03 | Complete or abandon the quest first, then let Timer B's time pass. | Timer B never fires. The console logs `timer missed` when the job comes due while the quest is not active. |

In-game console lines are the ones to quote in a report: `timer node … armed for …`,
`timer … fired`, `timer missed: quest …`, `cancelled N pending timer(s)`.

## Export history

| Export | Editor build | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0.3 | 2026-09-17.r175 | **Regenerated, awaiting a pass.** First build to carry `QESdk024TimerQa`; fixes the r166-era README claim that the export held one quest. |
| 1.0.2 | 2026-09-16.r166 | Tested on HackHub 1.3.0 / Steam build 25341308 — results below. |

### 1.0.2 results (editor surface only, no Timer quest)

- Startup mail and debug toasts appeared on a fresh save, after the `ui` permission
  was added for toasts.
- Wi-Fi passed: connecting to `QE24-LAB-5G` checked both Wi-Fi objectives, the BSSID
  matched `02:24:00:00:24:02`, and a reload left exactly one `QE24-LAB-5G`.
- HTTP did **not** pass: `http://qe24-website.test/` and `/echo` loaded, but neither
  the `http-request` nor the `http-response` objective ticked. Static website hosting
  works; editor-generated SDK HTTP event objectives stay fenced until SteelWaffe
  clarifies the static-site event semantics.
- DNS-only collaborator lookups (`nslookup <subdomain>.qe24-collab.test`) return
  `No results found` and produce no collaborator history entry in this build.
